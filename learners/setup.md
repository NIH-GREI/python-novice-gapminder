## Getting the Data

The data we will be using is taken from the [gapminder] dataset.
To obtain it, download and unzip the file
[python-novice-gapminder-data.zip](files/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip).
In order to follow the presented material, you should launch the JupyterLab
server in the root directory (see [Starting JupyterLab](episodes/01-run-quit.md#starting-jupyterlab)).

## Alternative Data Sources: Generalist Repositories

In addition to platforms like GitHub, researchers often use generalist repositories to store, share, and access datasets. These repositories are designed to preserve research outputs (like data, code, and workflows) in a citable, discoverable, and standardized way. They are particularly valuable for ensuring long-term accessibility and reproducibility of research.

### NIH-GREI Recommended Repositories
Under the NIH Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative ([GREI](https://datascience.nih.gov/data-ecosystem/generalist-repository-ecosystem-initiative)), several generalist repositories are recognized for hosting biomedical and scientific data. These include:

* Zenodo ([zenodo.org](https://about.zenodo.org/)): An open repository for EU-funded research but widely used globally.
* Dryad ([datadryad.org](https://datadryad.org/about)): A nonprofit repository focused on publishing and preserving research data.

These repositories assign DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) to datasets, making them easier to cite and track.

### Why Use Generalist Repositories?

* Long-term preservation: Ensures data remains accessible beyond project lifetimes.
* Compliance: Meets funder (e.g., NIH) and publisher requirements for data sharing.
* Interoperability: Standardized metadata makes data reusable across disciplines.

For this lesson, weâ€™ve provided the data via GitHub for simplicity, but we encourage you to explore these repositories for your own work.
